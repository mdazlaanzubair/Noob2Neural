# Noob2Neural
Welcome to my personal space for learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Learning! This repository holds the treasures of my journey, showcasing projects, experiments, and resources I gather along the way.

### **My Goals:**

* Gain hands-on experience through diverse projects.
* Deepen my understanding of key ML, DL, and AL concepts.
* Explore different applications of AI in various domains.
* Document my learning process for future reference and reflection.

### **What's Inside:**

* **Projects:** My explorations into different areas of ML, DL, and AL, each documented with code, data, and results.
  
  * **Project 1:** [**The Digit Detector**](https://github.com/mdazlaanzubair/Noob2Neural/blob/main/The_DD.ipynb) - A simple project that uses a neural network to classify the handwritten digits.
    
* **Experiments:** Playful tests with various algorithms and techniques to learn and understand their functionality.
  
* **Resources:** A collection of articles, tutorials, and datasets that fueled my learning journey.

### **Disclaimer:** 
This repository is primarily for my personal learning and experimentation. The code and projects might not be production-ready, but they reflect my learning journey and progress.

### **Feel free to:**

* Use my projects as inspiration for your own learning.
* Ask questions or share insights if you find anything interesting.

### **Happy learning!**
